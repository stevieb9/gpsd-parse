Revision history for GPSD-Parse

1.03    2019-10-23
        - fix issue in t/device.t where we were looking for a specific serial
          interface name, but may differ from the regex if there's a real GPS
          device connected (fixes #11, work on #9)
        - add links to internal POD sections, and added POD linkcheck test file
          (closes #7, closes #6)
        - add "Waiting for valid GPS signal" warning and return early from
          poll() if no data is available, instead of running blindly ahead and
          throwing irrelevant warnings (fixes #9)
        - added note about running gpsd with the '-n' flag
        - update tests to better handle test runs whether in file or socket mode

1.02    2018-02-28
        - added convenience methods lon(), lat(), alt(), climb(), speed() and
          track(). This alleviates a user from having to expand the indivitual
          statistic from tpv()

1.01    2017-05-26
        - slight code cleanup
        - POD fixes
        - added satellite listing example in POD
        - small fix to t/05-tpv.t. Needed to instantiate a scoped object
        - added signed() and unsigned(). Modifies the output for lat/lon during
          runtime. Send in $lat, $lon to optionally leave the object alone for
          manual one-off conversions
        - added metres() and feet() methods. These toggle at runtime

1.00    2017-05-17
        - updated tests and modified poll()'s handling of the file param when
          running with socket enabled
        - POD updates/corrections and additions
        - added example/sky.pl; Q&D satellite printout
        - all tests pass on a machine in both sock and non-sock mode

0.02    2017-05-17
        - reworked initialization code so that a file can be sent in to replay
          past data and for testing on systems that don't have gpsd. (closes #4)
        - on() is now called by default in new() if in socket mode, and off() is
          likewise called in the destructor
        - new() now has a 'metric' option to convert to using imperial/standard
          measurements where applicable (closes #1)
        - added 'signed' option in new() to convert from signed lat/lon to alpha
          (eg: from -1.23 to 1.23S) (closes #3)
        - added direction(), converts from degree heading to compass direction
          (eg: NNE, SW etc) (closes #2)

0.01    2017-05-16
        - first version, released on an unsuspecting world.
        - all current functionality has tests and documentation
        - new features will be added immediately (see issues), this is simply
          the first release to ensure all POD renders correctly on the CPAN
        - we dynaload JSON::XS, and if it fails, fall back to JSON::PP to avoid
          having to require non-core JSON in the Makefile.PL
